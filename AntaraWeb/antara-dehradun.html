                <p>The first step to creating the perfect community is choosing the right location. Accordingly, for the first Antara community, we chose 14 pristine acres in Purukul, Dehradun. Renowned for its serene beauty and comfortable weather throughout the year, Dehradun spoils for choice when it comes to stunning mountain ranges, shimmering lakes, lush green trails and places of historic value, all in close proximity to Antara.
                </p>
                <p>Dehradun is well connected by air, road and rail to Delhi and other major cities in India. In the neighbourhood are the spiritual towns of Haridwar and Rishikesh, and hill stations like Mussoorie and Dhanaulti. The natural reserve forests of Rajpur, Galjwari, Rikhauli and Chamasari and the Malsi Deer forest nearby provide the perfect opportunity to explore an interest in wildlife. For those who wish to remain active in business, Dehradun, being the capital of Uttarakhand, is an upcoming growth center.               
                </p>
                <p>Antara’s location in Purukul comes under the wellness and tourism zone of Dehradun’s master plan. The world-class healthcare of a Max Super Specialty hospital is reassuringly just a short drive away. Overlooking one of Dehradun’s picturesque river valleys, with clean air untainted by the effluents of a busy city, clear star-filled nights and warm, sunny days, framed by the Himalayas to the North and the Shivaliks to the South, there’s no better place than Antara to live the next chapter of a well-lived life.

                <p>Our design journey began with a pioneer of design and architecture, Bradford Perkins who is a true visionary in designing spaces that support independence as we get older. Bradford soon became a friend and a vital partner in Antara's journey, along with his team from the Perkins Eastman office in New York. 
                </p>
                <p>To partner Bradford, Tomeu Esteva of Esteva i Esteva Arquitectura, a boutique design firm in Mallorca, Spain and an expert in creating beauty through design, joined the team to give the community a sense of life and expand on Perkins functionality and detailing.              
                </p>
                <p>As the design journey progressed into execution, Integral Designs crafted the entire landscaping, Arcop Associates joined the team to complete our residential spaces while Studio Lotus gave life to our Clubhouse to truly make it the jewel in the crown of the community.

            <p>The Antara design philosophy is to improve your quality of life through thoughtful design interventions. 
            </p>
            <p><span>There are 7 apartment types in our Dehradun community which are spread over nine Residences, ranging from 130 - 614 sq. m. / 1500 – 6000 sq.ft and priced from INR 1.5 cr to 6.6 cr. To discuss which apartment is right for you, please call us at +91 8860076464/ +91 83929 26464.</span>             
            </p>
            <p>The interiors of each apartment are built to the highest standard and specifications, with elegant imported marble and wood flooring and beautiful finishing touches such as cornices and window ledges conveying a sense of timeless grace. Spacious naturally-lit bedrooms with extended terraces and balconies, a large sun-filled well-ventilated living and dining room and substantial windows for a beautiful view, all bring the magic of the outdoors into your everyday life. Bathrooms have thoughtfully positioned handrails, protective anti-skid tiles and walls clad with ceramic tiles. Tasteful and friendly modular kitchens with granite tops and ample storage space are abutted by a utility balcony. Detailing has been given special attention, such as rounded corners of all edges.
            </p>
            <p>All apartments have round the year climate control for a comfortable indoor ambience with significant savings in energy and maintenance. These and many other design features merge seamlessly to make your Antara apartment in its entirety exude an atmosphere of warmth, comfort and refinement.</p>
            <img src="images/drd3.png" class="centerImg"/>
            <br/>
            <p>An elaborate Clubhouse of approx. 50000 sq.ft. is sited at the end of the main spine of the master plan. The central<br/>idea of the Clubhouse at Antara is to function as a community living space for the residents and their guests  – a wonderful extension to their homes - a place to meet, interact, learn and pamper oneself. It accommodates dining spaces, eat-out verandahs, fine cuisine restaurants, card rooms, a bar, library, arts & craft studio, theatre, indoor games room, indoor heated pool. The clubhouse also has areas for well-being such as a salon, spa, gym, yoga pavilion and health bar.

            <p>The spaces have been planned in a manner that allows both for privacy as well as shared activities. The design approach is born of a synergy between state-of-the art engineering and local materials, woven together with a light and fresh contemporary expression. All areas in the facility have the option of being temperature controlled or naturally ventilated depending on the weather and use. Most areas have attached verandah spaces for indoor and outdoor use.
            </p>
            <p>All amenities are designed to the highest global senior living norms with a focus on physical and visual comfort, access, ergonomics and circulation. Special attention has been given to materials, colours and fixtures  to support residents with physical challenges and age-related needs.

                <div><p class="question quesn2"><img src="images/head_icn.png" width="18" height="20" />Who is eligible to become an Antara resident?</p>

                 <div><p class="question quesn7"><img src="images/head_icn.png" width="18" height="20" />Why Dehradun is chosen as the first location?</p>
                <p class="ans7">The first step to creating the perfect community is choosing the right location. Accordingly, for the first Antara community, we chose 14 pristine acres in Purukul, Dehradun. Renowned for its serene beauty and comfortable weather throughout the year, Dehradun spoils for choice when it comes to stunning mountain ranges, shimmering lakes, lush green trails and places of historic value, all in close proximity to Antara. 

Dehradun is well connected by air, road and rail to Delhi and other major cities in India. In the neighbourhood are the spiritual towns of Haridwar and Rishikesh, and hill stations like Mussoorie and Dhanaulti. The natural reserve forests of Rajpur, Galjwari, Rikhauli and Chamasari and the Malsi Deer forest nearby provide the perfect opportunity to explore an interest in wildlife. For those who wish to remain active in business, Dehradun, being the capital of Uttarakhand, is an upcoming growth center.

The world-class healthcare of a Max Super Specialty hospital is reassuringly just a short drive away. Overlooking one of Dehradun’s picturesque river valleys, with clean air untainted by the effluents of a busy city, clear star-filled nights and warm, sunny days, framed by the Himalayas to the North and the Shivaliks to the South, there’s no better place than Antara to live the next chapter of a well-lived life.

  <div><p class="question quesn4"><img src="images/head_icn.png" width="18" height="20" />How many apartments are there in Antara Dehradun&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and what are the sizes and pricing?</p>
                <p class="ans4">The Antara design philosophy is to improve your quality of life through thoughtful design interventions. </p>
<p class="ans4">
There are seven apartment types in our Dehradun community, which are spread over nine Residences, ranging from 1500 – 6000 sq.ft and priced from INR 1.5 cr to 6.6 cr. 
</p><p class="ans4">
The interiors of each apartment are built to the highest standard and specifications, with elegant imported marble and wood flooring and beautiful finishing touches such as cornices and window ledges conveying a sense of timeless grace. Spacious naturally-lit bedrooms with extended terraces and balconies, a large sun-filled well-ventilated living and dining room and substantial windows for a beautiful view all bring the magic of the outdoors into your everyday life. Bathrooms have thoughtfully positioned handrails, protective anti-skid tiles and walls clad with ceramic tiles. Tasteful and friendly modular kitchens with granite tops and ample storage space are abutted by a utility balcony. Detailing has been given special attention, such as rounded corners of all edges.</p>
<p class="ans4">
All apartments have round the year climate control for a comfortable indoor ambience with significant savings in energy and maintenance. These and many other design features merge seamlessly to make your Antara apartment in its entirety exude an atmosphere of warmth, comfort and refinement.
 </p></div>
 <div><p class="question quesn5"><img src="images/head_icn.png" width="18" height="20" />What is Antara Comprehensive Benefit?</p>
                <p class="ans5">To make your life at Antara hassle-free and always of the high standard you have come to expect, we offer our one of a kind anticipatory service package Antara Comprehensive Benefit (ACB).  Subscribing to ACB allows us to look after you and your home in the manner you are accustomed to. To ensure that the residents are well looked after, there are a host of services that have been designed under the ‘Antara Comprehensive Benefit’, ranging between INR 32,000 – 1,04,000, the charges are levied depending upon the size of the apartment and the services being opted. </p></div>
                
                <div><p class="question quesn3"><img src="images/head_icn.png" width="18" height="20" />What is the Lifetime Lease Advantage?</p>
                <p class="ans3">We have created an innovative leasehold structure for Antara. Applicants pay the fair market value of the apartment (as per their chosen payment plan) and are given a leasehold title deed on moving into the apartment. This leasehold title deed entitles the residents to live in the apartment for the rest of their lives.
                </p>
<p class="ans3">
•   How does the resale of the lease work?
If a resident wishes to leave the community, Antara will market the apartment to new eligible residents. Current residents can also recommend interested eligible residents. Before doing this, Antara will estimate the new fair market value of the apartment through independent experts. This fair market value will take into account appreciation. Antara will use this fair market value as a guide and conduct sales proceedings accordingly to ascertain the next resident. The new resident will then pay the amount he/she has offered. This amount will then be given to the exiting residents, minus our marketing charges 
</p>
<p class="ans3">
•   Can my nominees acquire leasehold rights to the apartment?
A resident can nominate a close relative, who meets the eligibility criteria, to live in the apartment after the passing of an existing resident. Antara will then issue a fresh lease deed in his/ her name for the remaining lease period.  

Alternatively, a resident may nominate a person other than a close relative as a subsequent lessee, who meets the eligibility criteria. This subsequent lessee can enjoy the rights to live in the apartment after the demise of the lessee.
</p>
<p class="ans3">
•   Why this lifetime leasehold model?
This model was judiciously created with our residents in mind and facilitates financial security to them. 

We want to ensure that Antara remains a like-minded community in the long run, and as such, we need a unique method to vet who becomes a resident in the community. 

This gives Antara the responsibility to ensure the community is maintained and managed to the highest standards.

This model also helps residents given that Antara will take the responsibility of ensuring that upon the demise of the current lessee’s all financial proceeds are passed on to their nominees.

                <div><p class="question quesn6"><img src="images/head_icn.png" width="18" height="20" />Who are the design and construction partners</p>
                <p class="ans6">Our design journey began with a pioneer of design and architecture, Bradford Perkins who is a true visionary in designing spaces that support independence as we get older. To partner Bradford, Tomeu Esteva of Esteva i Esteva Arquitectura, a boutique design firm in Mallorca, Spain and an expert in creating beauty through design, joined the team to give the community a sense of life and expand on Perkins functionality and detailing.
                As the design journey progressed into execution, Integral Designs crafted the entire landscaping, Arcop Associates joined the team to complete our residential spaces while Studio Lotus gave life to our Clubhouse to truly make it the jewel in the crown of the community.   </p></div>
               
                
                <div><p class="question quesn9"><img src="images/head_icn.png" width="18" height="20" />How large is the Community Operations Team? </p>
                <p  class="ans9">Once the community is operational, we will be having a team size of around 200. These team members will take charge of diverse areas including resident services, health and wellness, F&B, housekeeping, engineering & maintenance, security and support staff.  </p></div>

                <p>The first step to creating the perfect community is choosing the right location. Accordingly, for the first Antara community, we chose 14 pristine acres in Purukul, Dehradun. Renowned for its serene beauty and comfortable weather throughout the year, Dehradun spoils for choice when it comes to stunning mountain ranges, shimmering lakes, lush green trails and places of historic value, all in close proximity to Antara.
                </p>
                <p>Dehradun is well connected by air, road and rail to Delhi and other major cities in India. In the neighbourhood are the spiritual towns of Haridwar and Rishikesh, and hill stations like Mussoorie and Dhanaulti. The natural reserve forests of Rajpur, Galjwari, Rikhauli and Chamasari and the Malsi Deer forest nearby provide the perfect opportunity to explore an interest in wildlife. For those who wish to remain active in business, Dehradun, being the capital of Uttarakhand, is an upcoming growth center.               
                </p>
                <p>Antara’s location in Purukul comes under the wellness and tourism zone of Dehradun’s master plan. The world-class healthcare of a Max Super Specialty hospital is reassuringly just a short drive away. Overlooking one of Dehradun’s picturesque river valleys, with clean air untainted by the effluents of a busy city, clear star-filled nights and warm, sunny days, framed by the Himalayas to the North and the Shivaliks to the South, there’s no better place than Antara to live the next chapter of a well-lived life.

                <p>Our design journey began with a pioneer of design and architecture, Bradford Perkins who is a true visionary in designing spaces that support independence as we get older. Bradford soon became a friend and a vital partner in Antara's journey, along with his team from the Perkins Eastman office in New York. 
                </p>
                <p>To partner Bradford, Tomeu Esteva of Esteva i Esteva Arquitectura, a boutique design firm in Mallorca, Spain and an expert in creating beauty through design, joined the team to give the community a sense of life and expand on Perkins functionality and detailing.              
                </p>
                <p>As the design journey progressed into execution, Integral Designs crafted the entire landscaping, Arcop Associates joined the team to complete our residential spaces while Studio Lotus gave life to our Clubhouse to truly make it the jewel in the crown of the community.

            <p>The Antara design philosophy is to improve your quality of life through thoughtful design interventions. 
            </p>
            <p><span>There are 7 apartment types in our Dehradun community which are spread over nine Residences, ranging from 130 - 614 sq. m. / 1500 – 6000 sq.ft and priced from INR 1.5 cr to 6.6 cr. To discuss which apartment is right for you, please call us at +91 8860076464/ +91 83929 26464.</span>             
            </p>
            <p>The interiors of each apartment are built to the highest standard and specifications, with elegant imported marble and wood flooring and beautiful finishing touches such as cornices and window ledges conveying a sense of timeless grace. Spacious naturally-lit bedrooms with extended terraces and balconies, a large sun-filled well-ventilated living and dining room and substantial windows for a beautiful view, all bring the magic of the outdoors into your everyday life. Bathrooms have thoughtfully positioned handrails, protective anti-skid tiles and walls clad with ceramic tiles. Tasteful and friendly modular kitchens with granite tops and ample storage space are abutted by a utility balcony. Detailing has been given special attention, such as rounded corners of all edges.
            </p>
            <p>All apartments have round the year climate control for a comfortable indoor ambience with significant savings in energy and maintenance. These and many other design features merge seamlessly to make your Antara apartment in its entirety exude an atmosphere of warmth, comfort and refinement.</p>
            <img src="images/drd3.png" class="centerImg"/>
            <br/>
            <p>An elaborate Clubhouse of approx. 50000 sq.ft. is sited at the end of the main spine of the master plan. The central<br/>idea of the Clubhouse at Antara is to function as a community living space for the residents and their guests  – a wonderful extension to their homes - a place to meet, interact, learn and pamper oneself. It accommodates dining spaces, eat-out verandahs, fine cuisine restaurants, card rooms, a bar, library, arts & craft studio, theatre, indoor games room, indoor heated pool. The clubhouse also has areas for well-being such as a salon, spa, gym, yoga pavilion and health bar.

            <p>The spaces have been planned in a manner that allows both for privacy as well as shared activities. The design approach is born of a synergy between state-of-the art engineering and local materials, woven together with a light and fresh contemporary expression. All areas in the facility have the option of being temperature controlled or naturally ventilated depending on the weather and use. Most areas have attached verandah spaces for indoor and outdoor use.
            </p>
            <p>All amenities are designed to the highest global senior living norms with a focus on physical and visual comfort, access, ergonomics and circulation. Special attention has been given to materials, colours and fixtures  to support residents with physical challenges and age-related needs.

            <p>The Antara Way is our guiding principle to conceive and craft a beautifully designed community for the progressive few who believe age is jsut a number. Life as we get older is a time for renewal and reflections, a time to reconnect with ourselves and forge new bonds within a safe, inspiring and well managed environment. It is a time that is filled with hope and energy couples with the aspiration of less worry and a better quality of life. The vision of creating the first such community in India gave direction, shape and identity to what we call the Antara Way.
